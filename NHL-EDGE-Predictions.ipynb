    "## Baseline Model: MoneyPuck Expected Value\n",
    "\n",
    "MoneyPuck (https://moneypuck.com/index.html) publishes daily Win probabilities for every NHL game, calculated from their historical statistics. Their model consists of two submodels (Home and Away), which calculate each team's win probability independently, before being combined via the Meta model, which factors in home-ice advantage and rest time among other factors. A full description of MoneyPuck's model can be found here: https://moneypuck.com/about.htm <br>\n",
    "If we assume that MoneyPuck's model produces accurate win probabilities, a simple expected value formula can be used to identify profitable bets:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ EV = O*P(W) - 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \n",
    "* $EV$: Expected Value (%), Predicted Profit/Loss on a given bet\n",
    "* $O$: Odds (\\\\$ won per \\\\$ wagered), A team's moneyline decimal odds \n",
    "* $P(W)$: Win Probability, MoneyPuck's stated win probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Since decimal odds indicate how much one wins per dollar wagered, we subtract the cost to play from the expected payout ($O*P(W)$). <br>\n",
    "The predictions of our shot-location (NHL EDGE) model will be compared against MoneyPuck's results, both from a betting standpoint and in terms of overall accuracy. To give further insights into each model's betting performance, we will also analyze the performance of some simple betting strategies that do not make use of predictive models."
