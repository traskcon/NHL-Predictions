    "# NHL Predictive Model\n",
    "\n",
    "With the release of puck tracking stats via NHL EDGE, opportunities arise to build predictive models based on these data. The approach taken within is to begin with a simple shot-location based comparative predictive model. Additional models of increasing complexity will be developed as necessary."

Their model consists of two submodels (Home and Away), which calculate each team's win probability independently, before being combined via the Meta model, which factors in home-ice advantage and rest time among other factors. A full description of MoneyPuck's model can be found here: https://moneypuck.com/about.htm <br>\n",

    "Since decimal odds indicate how much one wins per dollar wagered, we subtract the cost to play from the expected payout ($O*P(W)$). <br>\n",
    "The predictions of our shot-location (NHL EDGE) model will be compared against MoneyPuck's results, both from a betting standpoint and in terms of overall accuracy. To give further insights into each model's betting performance, we will also analyze the performance of some simple betting strategies that do not make use of predictive models."
